Certainly! Below is a comprehensive exercise for a senior developer that spans approximately one week (40 hours) of work. The exercise is designed to challenge their skills in both backend (C#, MSSQL, EF) and frontend (Angular) development, while also encouraging best practices in architecture, testing, and performance optimization.

---

### **Exercise: Health Management System - Patient Dashboard Module**

#### **Objective**
Develop a **Patient Dashboard Module** for a Health Management System. The module should allow healthcare providers to view and manage patient health records, appointments, and prescriptions. The system should be secure, scalable, and user-friendly.

---

### **Requirements**

#### **Backend (C#, MSSQL, EF)**
1. **Database Design**:
   - Design a normalized database schema for the following entities:
     - **Patient**: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Contact Info, Medical History.
     - **Appointment**: Date, Time, Doctor, Patient, Status (Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled).
     - **Prescription**: Medication, Dosage, Frequency, Patient, Prescribing Doctor, Date.
   - Use MSSQL and Entity Framework (Code-First or Database-First) to implement the schema.

2. **API Development**:
   - Create a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core (C#) with the following endpoints:
     - `GET /api/patients`: Retrieve a list of patients with pagination and filtering (e.g., by name, date of birth).
     - `GET /api/patients/{id}`: Retrieve detailed information about a specific patient, including their appointments and prescriptions.
     - `POST /api/patients`: Add a new patient.
     - `PUT /api/patients/{id}`: Update patient details.
     - `GET /api/appointments`: Retrieve appointments for a specific patient or doctor.
     - `POST /api/appointments`: Schedule a new appointment.
     - `PUT /api/appointments/{id}`: Update appointment status.
     - `GET /api/prescriptions`: Retrieve prescriptions for a specific patient.
     - `POST /api/prescriptions`: Add a new prescription.
   - Implement input validation, error handling, and logging.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Secure the API using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Implement role-based access control:
     - **Admin**: Can manage all patients, appointments, and prescriptions.
     - **Doctor**: Can view and manage their own appointments and prescriptions.
     - **Patient**: Can view their own records.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize database queries using EF Core features like `AsNoTracking`, `Include`, and raw SQL where necessary.
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., patient lists).

5. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the API endpoints using xUnit or NUnit.
   - Mock dependencies (e.g., database context) to ensure test reliability.

---

#### **Frontend (Angular)**
1. **Dashboard UI**:
   - Create a responsive and user-friendly dashboard using Angular (v12+).
   - The dashboard should include:
     - A **Patient List** view with search, pagination, and filtering options.
     - A **Patient Details** view that displays the patient’s information, appointments, and prescriptions.
     - A form to add/edit patients, appointments, and prescriptions.

2. **State Management**:
   - Use Angular services and RxJS for state management.
   - Implement caching of API responses to reduce redundant API calls.

3. **Authentication**:
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend JWT authentication.
   - Implement login/logout functionality.
   - Restrict access to certain views based on user roles (e.g., only doctors can add prescriptions).

4. **UI/UX Best Practices**:
   - Use Angular Material or a similar UI library for consistent and modern design.
   - Ensure the application is accessible (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
   - Add loading indicators and error messages for API calls.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for Angular components and services using Jasmine and Karma.
   - Write end-to-end tests using Protractor or Cypress.

---

#### **Additional Features (Optional)**
1. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Use SignalR to implement real-time updates for appointments (e.g., notify the doctor when a new appointment is scheduled).

2. **Export Functionality**:
   - Allow exporting patient records (e.g., appointments, prescriptions) to PDF or Excel.

3. **Advanced Search**:
   - Implement full-text search for patient records using MSSQL’s full-text search capabilities.

4. **Dockerize the Application**:
   - Create Docker containers for the backend and frontend applications.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. **Backend**:
   - Source code for the ASP.NET Core API.
   - Database schema and migration scripts.
   - Unit tests.

2. **Frontend**:
   - Source code for the Angular application.
   - Unit and end-to-end tests.

3. **Documentation**:
   - A README file with instructions to set up and run the application.
   - API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).

4. **Optional**:
   - Docker configuration files.
   - A brief report on performance optimizations and design decisions.

---

### **Timeline**
- **Day 1-2**: Database design, API development, and authentication.
- **Day 3-4**: Frontend development (dashboard, forms, and state management).
- **Day 5**: Testing (backend and frontend).
- **Day 6**: Performance optimization and additional features.
- **Day 7**: Documentation and final touches.
